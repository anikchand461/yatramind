Krishna Janmasthan Temple is a Hindu temple situated in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. There are three main temples inside the premises -- Keshavdev temple which is dedicated to Krishna, Garbh Griha where Krishna is believed to be born in Dvapar Yuga and Bhagvata Bhavan where presiding deities are Radha Krishna.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

The place has held religious significance since at least the 6th century BCE with findings of religious artifacts in excavations.[8] The temples were destroyed multiple times throughout history, most recently by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1670. He built the Shahi Eidgah mosque there, which still stands.[3][4][5][9][8] In the 20th century, the new temple complex adjacent to mosque was built with the financial help from industrialists.[3]

Ancient and Classical Period
According to Hindu traditions, Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in a prison cell where they were confined by his maternal uncle Kamsa, a king of Mathura, due to prophecy of his death by the child of Devaki.[10][11] According to tradition, a temple dedicated to Krishna was built the birthplace by his great-grandson Vajranabh.[10][2] The present site known as Krishna Janmasthan (lit. 'birthplace of Krishna') was known as Katra (lit. 'market place') Keshavdeva.[8] The archaeological excavations of the site had revealed pottery and terracotta from 6th century BCE.[8] It also produced some Jain sculptures as well as a large Buddhist complex including Yasha Vihara.[8] The Vaishnava temple may have erected on the place as early as the first century.[8] A whole new magnificent temple complex was rebuilt at the place by Gupta Emperor Chandragupta II in 400CE.[1][12][13] A late 8th century inscriptions also mentions donations to the site by the Rashtrakutas.[10][3][4][5]

Medieval Period
In 1017 or 1018, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and plundered Mahaban. He ordered to burn all the temples and demolish them. He plundered gold and silver statues and carried away a load of hundred camels.[6][7] A stone inscription in Sanskrit found from the site mentions that in Vikram Samvat 1207 (1150) a person named Jajja who may have been a vassal of Gahadavala king built a Vishnu temple which was 'brilliantly white and touching the clouds'.[11][8]

Mughal Period
Vaishnava saints Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Vallabhacharya visited Mathura in early 16th century.[14][11][3][4] Abdullah, in the reign of Mughal emperor Jehangir, mentions in Tarikh-i-Daudi the destruction of Mathura and its temples by Delhi Sultan Sikandar Lodi in 16th century. Lodi had prohibited Hindus from bathing in the river and shaving of heads on the banks as well.[6][11] In the reign of Jehangir, in 1618, Raja Veer Singh Deva Bundela of Orchha had built a temple at the cost of thirty-three lakhs.[6][9][15] A French traveller Tavernier visited Mathura in 1650 and had described the octagonal temple built in red sandstone.[16][17][15] Italian traveller Niccolao Manucci who worked in Mughal court has also described the temple.[17] Mughal prince Dara Shikoh had patronised the temple and donated a railing to the temple.[9] The railing was removed by Mathura governor Abdun Nabi Khan on the order of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and he built the Jama mosque on the ruins of the Hindu temples. During the Jat rebellion in Mathura, Abdul Nabi Khan was killed in 1669.[18] Aurangzeb attacked Mathura and destroyed that Keshavdeva temple in 1670 and built the Shahi Eidgah in its place.[9][8]

Modern Period
Mathura came under British control in 1804. The East India Company auctioned the 5.41 hectares (13.37 acres) of land of Katra and it was purchased by Raja Patnimal, a wealthy banker of Banaras.[19][10][20][21] Raja Patnimal wanted to build the temple but could not do so. His descendants inherited the land of Katra and still maintained the full 5.41 hectares (13.37 acres) without splitting it up. His descendant Rai Krishna Das was challenged, for the ownership of 5.41 hectares (13.37 acres) of land on which the shrine and the Shahi Eidgah is situated, in two civil suits by the Muslims of Mathura but the Allahabad High Court ruled in favour of Raj Krishna Das in both suits in 1935.[20][21] Kailash Nath Katju and Madanmohan Chaturvedi had helped in these lawsuits. Politician and educationist Madan Mohan Malaviya acquired the land from Raj Krishna Das on 7 February 1944 at the cost of Rs. 13000 with financial help of Industrialist Jugal Kishore Birla.[10][20][21] Following the death of Malaviya, Jugal Kishore Birla formed a trust named Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust, later registered as the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan, on 21 February 1951 and acquired the full 5.41 hectares (13.37 acres) of land.[20][21] Jugal Kishore Birla entrusted the construction of the new temple with another industrialist and philanthropist Jaidayal Dalmia. The construction of the temple complex was started in October 1953 with leveling of lands and completed in February 1982. His eldest son Vishnu Hari Dalmia succeeded him and served on the Trust until his death. His grandson Anurag Dalmia is Joint Managing Trustee on the Trust.[10][20] The construction was funded by other business families including Ramnath Goenka.[10]

In 1968, the Shree Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sangh and the Shahi Eidgah committee reached a compromise agreement which granted the temple land to the Trust and the management of the Shahi Eidgah to the Eidgah committee as well no legal claim of the Shree Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sangh on the Shahi Eidgah.[21][12] Indian National Congress leader Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar was the first chairman of the Shree Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sangh which signed the compromise agreement and his legal authority to sign agreement is contested. He was succeeded by M. A. Ayyangar, followed by Akhandananda Saraswati and Ramdev Maharaj. Nrityagopaldas is the present chairman.[20] Following the demolition of the Babri Mosque in 1992, Manohar Lal Sharma, a resident of Vrindavan, has filed a petition in the Mathura District Court challenging the 1968 agreement as well as a petition to quash the Places of Religious Worship Act of 1991 which preserves the status quo as on 15 August 1947 for all places of worship.[21][13]


The site celebrated as the birthplace of Krishna who, as tradition goes, was born in a prison and the prison is said to have existed on the plot marked by a stone plate. To the right of it is the Shahi Eidgah. The image is taken in 1949 before the modern temple complex was built.

Other construction includes the Ayurveda Bhavan, International Guest House, shops, library and open space for performances.[10]

Potra Kund
There is a large and deep stepped water tank, Potra Kund or Pavitra Kund, in south-east of the Janmasthan temple which is said to have been used for the first bath of child Krishna after his birth.[25][2] The steps of the tank were built by Mahadji Scindia in 1782. They were restored by his descendants in 1850.[10]

Culture
The temple is one of the most visited temples in India. Krishna Janmashtami, Radhashtami, Diwali and Holi are the major festivals celebrated at this temple and entire Braj region.






## Mathura - Birthplace of Krishna

Mathura, a city steeped in ancient history and profound religious significance, holds a central place in the hearts of millions of Hindus worldwide as the revered birthplace of Lord Krishna. The narrative of Krishna's birth is not merely a historical account but a fundamental scripture woven into the fabric of Hindu mythology, primarily detailed in texts like the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana.
The specific site of this divine event is the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi complex, located in the modern city of Mathura in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Within this sprawling complex lies the Garbha Griha, an underground prison cell believed to be the exact spot where Krishna was born approximately 5,000 years ago. This small chamber is now a sacred shrine, a focal point for pilgrims and devotees.
The circumstances surrounding Krishna's birth are central to the story of divine intervention overcoming tyranny. According to legend, Mathura was ruled by Kamsa, a cruel king and the brother of Devaki. A celestial prophecy warned Kamsa that the eighth son born to his sister, Devaki, and her husband, Vasudeva, would be the cause of his demise. Driven by fear and paranoia, Kamsa imprisoned the couple and brutally killed their first seven children immediately after birth.
However, when the eighth child, Krishna, was born, a series of miraculous events unfolded. The prison guards fell into a deep sleep, the heavy iron gates miraculously opened, and Vasudeva's shackles were loosed. Acting on divine instruction, Vasudeva carried the newborn infant across the Yamuna River, which parted its waters to make way, to the safe haven of Gokul. There, he exchanged Krishna with a baby girl born to the cowherd Nanda and his wife Yashoda, returning to the prison cell with the female infant. Kamsa, attempting to kill the eighth child, was thwarted as the female infant revealed her divine form and vanished, reaffirming the prophecy.
This powerful narrative highlights the Hindu belief in the avatar concept—the descent of a deity to earth in a physical form to restore dharma (righteousness) and destroy evil forces. Krishna's birth in a dark, confined prison cell symbolizes the emergence of divine light amidst darkness and oppression.
The spiritual significance of Mathura extends far beyond the temple walls. It is one of the Sapta Puri, the seven most holy pilgrimage centers for Hindus. The entire region around Mathura, known as Braj, is suffused with stories of Krishna’s childhood and youth—his playful antics in Gokul, his divine dance with the gopis in Vrindavan, and his eventual return to Mathura to defeat Kamsa.
The celebration of Janmashtami, the festival marking Krishna's birthday, reaches its peak in Mathura. The city comes alive with vibrant decorations, devotional songs (bhajans), and elaborate theatrical re-enactments of the birth story (Ras Lila). The main festivities at the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple are particularly moving, with special rituals performed precisely at midnight, the exact moment of his birth.
Mathura, therefore, is more than a geographical location; it is a spiritual heartland, a testament to enduring faith, where the physical structure of a temple prison cell serves as a powerful reminder of the arrival of one of Hinduism's most beloved and revered deities.

## The Divine Journey: A Comprehensive Guide to the Mathura Pilgrimage


Mathura, a city resonating with the sound of temple bells, devotional chants of "Radhe Radhe," and ancient legends, is the sacred heart of the Braj region and one of Hinduism's seven holiest cities (Sapta Puri). A pilgrimage to Mathura is not merely a physical journey through temples and historical sites; it is a profound immersion into the life and leelas (divine pastimes) of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu. Every corner of this ancient land, from the bustling ghats of the Yamuna to the serene groves of Vrindavan, is steeped in a spiritual energy that draws millions of devotees seeking solace, blessings, and salvation.
The Epicenter of Devotion: Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi
The focal point of the entire pilgrimage is the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple Complex. This is the exact site where, according to scriptures, Lord Krishna was born in an underground prison cell while his parents, Devaki and Vasudeva, were held captive by the tyrannical King Kamsa.
The Garbha Griha (sanctum sanctorum) within the complex is a small, hallowed chamber that preserves the original prison cell. Visiting this spot is an intensely emotional experience for pilgrims, who feel a direct connection to the moment the divine manifested on earth to restore dharma (righteousness). The adjacent Keshavdeva Temple and Bhagvata Bhavan are integral parts of the complex, filled with devotees offering prayers and participating in rituals.
The Sacred Yamuna and Vishram Ghat
The holy Yamuna River is considered a goddess in the Braj region and plays a vital role in the pilgrimage. Mathura is lined with 25 ghats (steps leading to the river), with the most significant being Vishram Ghat. It is here that Lord Krishna is believed to have rested after defeating Kamsa.
Pilgrims often begin their spiritual journey with a holy dip in the Yamuna at Vishram Ghat to cleanse their sins. The evening aarti (a fire ceremony with prayers) at the ghat is a mesmerizing spectacle of hundreds of lamps floating on the river, accompanied by devotional songs, creating a deeply serene atmosphere that is a must-experience for any pilgrim.
Exploring the Braj Circuit: Vrindavan, Gokul, and Barsana
Mathura serves as the gateway to the wider Braj region, where the pilgrimage experience expands to cover other key locations in Krishna's life. The traditional pilgrimage, known as the Braj Chaurasi Kos Yatra, is a 252-kilometer circumambulation of the entire area, often undertaken by devout pilgrims over several days or weeks. Modern pilgrims usually focus on the main towns:

## Krishna temple Mathura

The primary Krishna temple in Mathura is the Shri Krishna Janmasthani Temple Complex, a profoundly significant pilgrimage site that marks the exact spot where Lord Krishna is believed to have been born. The complex is a vibrant spiritual hub with a rich history of destruction and reconstruction, symbolizing the enduring faith of devotees.
The Shri Krishna Janmasthan Temple Complex: The Birthplace of a Deity
The entire complex is built around the underground prison cell, or Garbha Griha, where the divine event of Krishna's birth to Devaki and Vasudeva is said to have occurred over 5,000 years ago. This small, unadorned chamber is the spiritual heart of the site, where a marble pavilion marks the precise spot of his manifestation. The atmosphere in the Garbha Griha is one of intense reverence, and pilgrims often stand in awe, contemplating the miraculous circumstances of the Lord's arrival to vanquish the evil king Kamsa.
Architectural Components
The sprawling complex encompasses several integrated structures:
Keshavdeva Temple: This is the main, ornate temple built adjacent to the Garbha Griha. It houses beautiful idols of Radha and Krishna and is known for its intricate carvings and fusion of architectural styles. The temple was inaugurated in 1958 with the financial support of the industrialist Birla family.
Bhagvata Bhavan: A large hall dedicated to the Shrimad Bhagavata Purana, the scripture that narrates Krishna's life and teachings. The walls and pillars of the assembly hall are adorned with frescoes depicting scenes from Krishna's life, and the entire text of the Bhagavad Gita is inscribed on copper plates along the circumambulation path (parikrama). This area houses multiple shrines for various deities, including Balarama, Subhadra, Jagannath, Sita, Rama, and Lakshman.
Potra Kund: Located southeast of the main temple, this large, ancient stepped water tank is believed to be the spot where the newborn Krishna was given his first bath.
Yogmaya Temple: A small shrine dedicated to the eight-handed goddess Yogmaya stands near the entrance of the sanctum, marking the place where the infant girl Vasudeva swapped with Krishna vanished after defying Kamsa.
A History of Resilience
The site has witnessed a turbulent history, with temples being destroyed and rebuilt multiple times. The first temple was allegedly built by Krishna's great-grandson, Vajranabha. Over the centuries, subsequent temples were razed by invaders like Mahmud of Ghazni and Sikandar Lodi. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb built a mosque, the Shahi Eidgah, on the ruins of the fourth temple in 1670. The current complex was finally reconstructed in the 20th century, a project completed in 1982 through public and industrialist efforts.
Festivals and Spiritual Vibe
The temple buzzes with activity throughout the year, but the atmosphere is transcendent during festivals. Janmashtami (Krishna's birthday) is the grandest event, marked by midnight aartis (rituals) and widespread celebrations. Holi, Radhashtami, and Diwali also attract huge crowds. The rigorous security measures, which prohibit electronic items like phones and cameras, contribute to a focused, spiritual experience, allowing visitors to immerse themselves fully in devotion.
Other Notable Temples in Mathura
While the Janmasthan complex is paramount, Mathura is home to other significant temples:
Dwarkadhish Temple: A vibrant, historic temple located near Vishram Ghat on the Yamuna River. Known for its elaborate Rajasthani architecture and a beautiful black marble idol of Lord Krishna, it is one of the city's main attractions.
Gita Mandir (Birla Mandir): A modern temple noted for its unique architecture and the complete text of the Bhagavad Gita inscribed on its inner walls, built by the Birla family.
