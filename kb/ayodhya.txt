Ram Janmabhoomi (lit. 'Birthplace of Rama') is the site that, according to Hindu religious beliefs, is the birthplace of Rama, the seventh avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu. The Ramayana states that the location of Rama's birthplace is on the banks of the Sarayu river in a city called "Ayodhya". Modern-day Ayodhya is in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is contested whether the Ayodhya mentioned in the Ramayana is the same as the modern city.[1][2]

Some Hindus claim that the exact site of Rama's birthplace is within the grounds where the Babri Masjid once stood in the present-day Ayodhya,[3] with this belief extending back to at least 1822.[2] It has been suggested that a temple to Rama formerly existed at the same site as the Babri Masjid until it was replaced by the mosque, an idea supported by a court-ordered report of the Archaeological Survey of India following archaeological excavations around the ruins of the mosque, though the existence of this temple and the conclusions of the report are disputed.[4][5]

Idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949 and devotees began to gather from the next day.[6][7] In 1992, the demolition of the Babri Masjid by Hindu nationalists triggered widespread Hindu-Muslim violence. The legal dispute over the property reached the Indian Supreme Court,[8][9] which ruled in November 2019 that the property be handed to a trust to construct a Hindu temple.[10]

Ayodhya disputed site map
The Ramayana, a Hindu epic whose earliest portions date back to 1st millennium BCE, states that the capital of Rama was "Ayodhya", which may not be the same as modern Ayodhya[1][11] According to the local Hindu belief, the site of the now-demolished Babri Mosque in Ayodhya is the exact birthplace of Rama. The Babri mosque is believed to have been constructed during 1528–29 by a certain 'Mir Baqi' (possibly Baqi Tashqandi), who was a commander of the Mughal emperor Babur (r. 1526–1530).[12]

In 1611, an English traveller William Finch visited Ayodhya and recorded the "ruins of the Ranichand [Ramachand] castle and houses". He made no mention of a mosque.[13][14] In 1634, Thomas Herbert described a "pretty old castle of Ranichand [Ramachand]" which he described as an antique monument that was "especially memorable".[15] However, by 1672, the appearance of a mosque at the site can be inferred because Lal Das's Awadh-Vilasa describes the location without mentioning a castle, house or temple.[16] In 1717, the Moghul Rajput noble Jai Singh II purchased land surrounding the site and his documents show a mosque.[17] The Jesuit missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler, who visited the site between 1766 and 1771, wrote that either Aurangazeb (r. 1658–1707) or Babur had demolished the Ramkot fortress, including the house that was considered as the birthplace of Rama by Hindus. He further stated that a mosque was constructed in its place, but the Hindus continued to offer prayers at a mud platform that marked the birthplace of Rama.[18] In 1810, Francis Buchanan visited the site, and stated that the structure destroyed was a temple dedicated to Rama, not a house. Many subsequent sources state that the mosque was constructed after demolishing a temple.[18] Buchanan also recorded that there was an inscription on the wall of the mosque stating it to have been built by Babur.

Police officer and writer Kishore Kunal, who examined Buchanan's documents, states that all the claimed inscriptions on the Babri mosque were fake. According to him they were affixed sometime around 1813 (almost 285 years after the supposed construction of the mosque in 1528 CE), and later repeatedly replaced.[19]

Before the 1940s, the Babri Masjid was called Masjid-i-Janmasthan ("mosque of the birthplace") in common parlance as well as official documents such as revenue records.[20] Shykh Muhammad Azamat Ali Kakorawi Nami (1811–1893) wrote: "the Babari mosque was built up in 923(?) A.H. under the patronage of Sayyid Musa Ashiqan in the Janmasthan temple in Faizabad-Avadh, which was a great place of (worship) and capital of Rama's father."[21]

H.R. Neville, the editor of the Faizabad District Gazetteer (1870), wrote that the Janmasthan temple "was destroyed by Babur and replaced by a mosque." He also wrote "The Janmasthan was in Ramkot and marked the birthplace of Rama. In 1528 A.D. Babur came to Ayodhya and halted here for a week. He destroyed the ancient temple and on its site built a mosque, still known as Babur's mosque. The materials of the old structure [i.e., the temple] were largely employed, and many of the columns were in good preservation."[22][23]

Al-Hind-u fi al – ‘Ahd al-Isami, by Maulana Shams Tabriz Khan describes "And among them is the great mosque that was built by the Timurid king Babar in the sacred city of Ajodhya. It is believed that Rama Chandra, considered to be the manifestation of God, was born here. There is a long story about his wife Sita. There was a big temple for them in this city. At a certain place Sita used to sit and cook food for her consort. Well, the said king Babar demolished it and built a mosque at that very place with chiseled stone in 923 A.H."[24]

Opposition to the claim

A section of historians, such as R. S. Sharma, state that such claims of Babri Masjid site being the birthplace of Rama sprang up only after the 18th century and Janmabhoomi's location given in the various Ayodhya-mahatmyas does not tally with the Babri Masjid location.[18][25] Sharma states that Ayodhya emerged as a place of Hindu pilgrimage only in medieval times, since ancient texts do not mention it as a pilgrim centre. For example, chapter 85 of the Vishnu Smriti (contains the earliest list of tirthas[25]) lists 52 places of pilgrimage, which do not include Ayodhya.[26][11]

Many critics also claim that the present-day Ayodhya was originally a Buddhist site, based on its identification with Saketa described in Buddhist texts. According to historian Romila Thapar, ignoring the Hindu mythological accounts, the first historic mention of the city dates back to the 7th century, when the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang described it as a Buddhist site.[27][28]: 25 

Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir

In 1853, a group of armed Hindu ascetics belonging to the Nirmohi Akhara occupied the Babri Masjid site, and claimed ownership of the structure.[29] Subsequently, the civil administration stepped in, and in 1855, divided the mosque premises into two parts: one for Hindus, and the other for Muslims.[30]

In 1883, the Hindus launched an effort to construct a temple on the platform. When the administration denied them the permission to do this, they took the matter to court. In 1885, the Sub Judge Pandit Hari Kishan Singh dismissed the lawsuit. Subsequently, the higher courts also dismissed the lawsuit in 1886, in favour of status quo. The lawsuit was dismissed on the grounds that creating a Hindu temple in close proximity to mosque would create a serious law and order issue. The District Judge held that it was ―most unfortunate that the Masjid should have been built on the land especially held sacred by the Hindus but since the construction had been made 358 years earlier, it was too late in the day to reverse the process.[31]

In December 1949, some Hindus placed idols of Rama and Sita in the mosque, and claimed that they had miraculously appeared there. Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru directed the state's Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant to remove the idols, however Pant was not willing to remove the idols and added that "there is a reasonable chance of success, but things are still in a fluid state and it will be hazardous to say more at this stage".[32][33] By 1950, the state took control of the structure under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site.[34]

In the 1980s, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and other Hindu nationalist groups and political parties launched a campaign to construct the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir ("Rama birthplace temple") at the site. In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi government allowed Hindus to access the site for prayers.[35] On 6 December 1992, Hindu nationalists demolished the mosque, resulting in communal riots leading to over 2,000 deaths.[36]

In 2003, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) conducted excavations of the site on court orders.[37] The ASI report indicated the presence of a 10th-century north Indian style temple under the mosque.[38] Muslim groups and the historians supporting them disputed these findings, and dismissed them as politically motivated.[39][40] The Allahabad High Court, however, upheld the ASI's findings.[41] The excavations by the ASI were heavily used as evidence by the court that the predating structure was a massive Hindu religious building.[42]

In 2009, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) released its election manifesto, repeating its promise to construct a temple to Rama at the site.[43][44]

In 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) of disputed land be divided into 3 parts, with 1⁄3 going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Lord Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha for the construction of the Ram temple, 1⁄3 going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board and the remaining 1⁄3 going to a Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara.[45] All the three parties appealed against the division of disputed land to the Supreme Court.[46][47]

The five judges Supreme Court bench heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019.[8][9] The court inferred that the foundation of the mosque was based on the walls of a large pre existing structure dating back to the 12th century whose architectural features are suggestive of Hindu religious origin. The Supreme Court however concluded that there is time gap between the existence of the pre existing structure in 12th century and the construction of mosque in 16th century and no archaeological evidence on the cause of destruction of the underlying structure from this era is available.[31] On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered to the government to give alternate 5 acre land to Sunni Waqf Board to build the mosque.[10] On 5 February 2020, the trust known as Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra was created by the government of India.

Other places
Those who believe that Rama was a historic figure, place his birth around 1800 BCE. However, the archaeological excavations at Ayodhya have not revealed any significant settlement before 500 BCE. Consequently, a number of other places have been suggested as the birthplace of Rama.[11]

In November 1990, the newly appointed Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar made an attempt to resolve the Ayodhya dispute amicably. Towards this objective, he asked Hindu and Muslim groups to exchange evidence on their claims over Ayodhya. The panel representing the Muslim organization Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) included R. S. Sharma, D. N. Jha, M. Athar Ali and Suraj Bhan. The evidence presented by them included scholarly articles discussing alternative theories about the birthplace of Rama. These sources mentioned 8 different possible birthplaces, including a site other than Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, Nepal and Afghanistan.[48] One author – M. V. Ratnam – claimed that Rama was Ramses II, a pharaoh of ancient Egypt.[49]

In his 1992 book Ancient geography of Ayodhya, historian Shyam Narain Pande argued that Rama was born around present-day Herat in Afghanistan.[50] In 1997, Pande presented his theory in the paper "Historical Rama distinguished from God Rama" at the 58th session of the Indian History Congress in Bangalore. In 2000, Rajesh Kochhar similarly traced the birthplace of Rama to Afghanistan, in his book The Vedic People: Their History and Geography. According to him, the Harriud river of Afghanistan is the original "Sarayu", and Ayodhya was located on its banks.[51]

In 1998, archaeologist Krishna Rao put forward his hypothesis about Banawali being Rama's birthplace. Banawali is an Harappan site located in the Haryana state of India. Rao identified Rama with the Sumerian king Rim-Sin I and his rival Ravana with the Babylonian king Hammurabi. He claimed to have deciphered Indus seals found along the Sarasvati rivers, and found the words "Rama Sena" (Rim-Sin) and "Ravani dama" on those seals. He rejected Ayodhya as the birthplace of Rama, on the grounds that Ayodhya and other Ramayana sites excavated by B. B. Lal do not show evidence of settlements before 1000 BCE. He also claimed that the writers of the later epics and the Puranas got confused because the ancient Indo-Aryans applied their ancient place names to the new place names as they migrated eastwards.[52]

Archaeological Survey of India
First Excavation
A team from the Archaeological Survey of India under B. B. Lal conducted a survey of the land in 1976–77.[53] They found 12 pillars of the mosque that were made from the remains of a Hindu temple. The base of the pillars had a Purna Kalasha which was a 'ghada' (water pitcher) from which foliage would be coming out. These symbols were found in almost all the temples of the 12th and 13th Century.[53] For Hindus, it is one of the eight auspicious symbols of prosperity also known as Ashtamangala Chinha.[54] The excavation team found many terracotta sculptures that depicted human beings and animals, a characteristic of a temple, not a mosque.[53]

Second excavation
In 2003, A 50 plus member team of Archeological Survey of India did the second excavation. They found over 50 pillars, hinting that below the mosque stood a Hindu temple that could be dated back to the 12th Century AD.[55]

Temple Pranali
The excavators further found a temple system that depicted a crocodile (a symbol of the Holy Ganga[56]) to signify a symbolic bath in the holy rivers of the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati to wash off one's sins. They also got the temple 'pranali' (system). We have to bathe the deity and the 'abhisheka jal' flows through 'pranali'. This 'makara pranali' was also excavated.[53]

Kalasha, Amalkam Grivaha and Shikhara
The ASI team unearthed several remains of a temple's 'shikhara' (tower) from the mosque's premises, adding to the evidences of a Hindu structure underneath[53] ASI team also found another architectural member known as 'amalka'. Below the 'amalka' there is the 'grivah' and also the 'shikhara' portion of the temple in North India.[53]

Terracotta remains
The ASI archaeologists found 263 pieces of terracotta objects of gods, goddesses, human figures, female figurines that consolidated the theory that it was the site of a temple.

Vishnu Hari Shila Phalak
An inscription of 'Vishnu Hari Shila Phalak' was found on two remains found at the site that proved to be an important circumstantial evidence that stated the existence of a Hindu temple there.[53]


2023 excavations to construct new Rama Temple

In 2023, during excavation to make Rama temple after Supreme Court order, remains of ancient temple, idols, and pillars were found.[57]

In 2024, BR Mani, the archaeologist who led the 2003 excavations urged the central government to release the ASI report to put all the doubts regarding the report to rest.[58] He also interprets the evidence from excavations to claim that there was human force involved in the destruction of the found structure and the structure was not destroyed because of any natural calamity. He claims the destruction took place at about the same time when mosque was being built. Further, he says the court didn't comment on whether the destruction took place because ASI report was only meant to report findings and not interpret those findings. He said that excavations show that the history of the site can be traced back to 17th century BCE which contradicts the earlier scholarly claim that history of Ayodhya started at 7th century BCE[59]

Construction of Ram Mandir

The Ram Mandir (ISO: Rāma Maṁdira, lit. 'Rama Temple'), is a partially constructed Hindu temple complex in Ayodhya,[a] Uttar Pradesh, India.[6][7] Many Hindus believe that it is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the mythical birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.[8][9]

The temple was inaugurated[7] on 22 January 2024 after a religious ceremony.[6][10] On the first day of its opening, following the consecration, the temple received a rush of over half a million visitors,[11] and after a month, the number of daily visitors was reported to be between 100,000 and 150,000.[12]

The site of the temple has been the subject of communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India, as it is the former location of the Babri Masjid, which was built between 1528 and 1529. Idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992.[13][14][15] In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a temple, while Muslims were given land nearby in Dhannipur in Ayodhya to construct a mosque.[16] The court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.[17]

On 5 August 2020, the bhūmi pūjana (transl. ground breaking ceremony) for the commencement of the construction of Ram Mandir was performed by Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India.[18] The temple complex, currently under construction, is being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. On 22 January 2024, Modi served as the Mukhya Yajamāna (transl. chief patron) of rituals for the event and performed the prāṇa pratiṣṭhā (transl. consecration) of the temple.[19][20] The prana pratishtha ceremony was organised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.[21][22] The temple has also attracted a number of controversies due to alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its major activists, and politicisation of the temple by the Bharatiya Janata Party.[23][24][25][26]

Background
Significance of Rama

Ram Lalla, the five-year old form of Rama is the principal deity of the Ram Mandir.
Rama is a prominent Hindu deity who is regarded as a Pūrṇāvatāra (lit. 'complete avatar') of the God Vishnu.[d] Some Hindus view Rama as Para Brahman (lit. 'The ultimate Brahman'). Rama holds immense significance in Hinduism. According to Hindu mythology, the Rama avatar is not supposed to exhibit any of Vishnu's divine potencies, and he leads his life as a human.[28] As Rama is said to have possessed sixteen ideal qualities, Hindus view Rama as Puruṣottama (lit. 'Ideal man'), Vigrahavān dharmaḥ (lit. 'Embodiment of Dharma'), and Ādi Puruṣa (lit. 'First man' or 'Primordial being').[29][30][e] According to the Hindu epic Ramayana, Rama was born in a mythical city named Ayodhya.[31] The present-day city of Ayodhya, which emerged in the second century CE, is a separate settlement and not the same as the Hindu mythical city of the same name.[32][33] Present-day Ayodhya was named "Saketa" until it was renamed in the fifth century CE by a king of the Gupta Empire who wished to associate himself with the mythical birthplace of Rama.[34]

Deity
See also: Balak Ram
The Ram Mandir is being built to commemorate the birth of Rama: therefore, the presiding deity of the temple is supposed to be the infant form of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. Rama in that infant form was referred as Ram Lalla (lit. 'Child Rama') by Tulsidas. However, the idol of Rama that was placed in 1949 referred to as Ram Lalla Virajman (lit. 'Installed Child Rama') by local Hindus.[35] Ram Lalla was a litigant in the court case over the disputed site in 1989, being considered a "juristic person" by the law.[3] He was represented by Triloki Nath Pandey, a senior VHP leader who was considered Ram Lalla's closest 'human' friend.[35] As a new idol of the deity got installed in the sanctum sanctorum as the Mūlavirāt mūrti (lit. The main presiding deity),[f] the Mandir Trust has informed that the Ram Lalla Virajman idol of 1949 shall henceforth be used as Utsava mūrti (lit. idol for festivals).[38]

The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid, which was built in the 16th century. The mosque was attacked and demolished in 1992.[13][14][15] In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for the construction of a temple, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque.[39]

Medieval
In 1528, a commander of the Mughal Empire, Mir Baqi, constructed the Babri Masjid mosque, under the order of Babur. The site chosen for the mosque is identified by many Hindus as Ram Janmabhoomi, the mythical birthplace of Rama.[40] The earliest record of the mosque may be traced back to 1767, in the Latin book Descriptio Indiae, authored by the Jesuit missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler. According to him, the local population believed that the mosque was constructed by destroying the Ramkot temple, believed to be the fortress of Rama in Ayodhya, and the Bedi, where the birthplace of Rama is situated.[41][42]

Modern

Ram Mandir in 2024
Disputed location
The first instance of religious violence was documented in 1853.[43] In December 1858, the British administration prohibited Hindus from conducting puja (rituals) at the contested site. A platform was created for conducting rituals outside the mosque.[44]

Murtis (transl. sacred idols) of Rama and Sita were installed inside the Babri Masjid on the night of 22–23 December 1949, after which devotees began visiting the site.[13][45] By 1950, the state took control of the mosque under Section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site.[46]

In the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), belonging to the Hindu nationalist family, Sangh Parivar, launched a new movement to reclaim the site for Hindus and to erect a temple dedicated to the infant Rama (Ram Lalla) at this spot. The VHP began to collect funds and bricks with "Jai Shri Ram" written on them. Later, the government under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi gave the VHP permission for Shilanyas (transl. the foundation stone ceremony) to proceed, with the then Home Minister, Buta Singh, formally conveying the permission to the VHP leader, Ashok Singhal. Initially, the Government of India and the Government of Uttar Pradesh had agreed that the shilanyas would be conducted outside of the disputed site. However, on 9 November 1989, a group of VHP leaders and Sadhus laid the foundation stone by digging a 200-litre (7-cubic-foot) pit adjacent to the disputed land. The singhdwar (transl. main entrance) of the sanctum sanctorum was constructed there.[47] The VHP then laid the foundations of a temple on the land adjacent to the disputed mosque.

Demolition of the Babri Masjid
Main article: Demolition of the Babri Masjid
On 6 December 1992, the VHP and the Bharatiya Janata Party organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as karsevaks. The rally turned violent, the crowd overwhelmed the security forces and tore down the mosque.[48][49]

The demolition of the mosque resulted in several months of inter-communal violence between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of an estimated 2,000 people in Bombay (now Mumbai) as a direct consequence, and triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent.[50] A day after the demolition of the mosque, on 7 December 1992, The New York Times reported that over 30 Hindu temples across Pakistan were attacked, some set on fire, and one was demolished. Hindu temples in Bangladesh were also attacked.[48]

On 5 July 2005, five terrorists attacked the makeshift Ram temple at the site of the destroyed Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. All five were shot dead in the ensuing encounter with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), while one civilian died in the grenade attack that the attackers launched to breach the cordoned wall. The CRPF suffered three casualties, two of whom were seriously injured with multiple gunshot wounds.[51][52]

ASI excavations
Reports on two archaeological excavations in 1978 and 2003 conducted by the ASI claimed to have found evidence indicating that a temple existed on the site.[53][54] The claims were heavily disputed by critics as contradictory and unreliable.[55][56][57][58][59] Archaeologist K. K. Muhammed maintained that remains of a Hindu temple were found in 1978, and accused several historians of averting a settlement for the dispute.[60]

Court rulings
Over the years, various title and legal disputes took place, such as the passage of the Acquisition of Certain Areas at Ayodhya Act in 1993. In 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the 1.12 hectares (2.77 acres) of disputed land be divided into three parts, one going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Rama, represented by the Hindu Mahasabha for the construction of the Ram temple, one going to the Muslim Sunni Waqf Board, and one going to Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara.[8][61] All three parties involved appealed against the division of disputed land to the Supreme Court.[62][63]

In the Supreme Court's verdict on the Ayodhya dispute in 2019, it was decided that the disputed land would be handed over to a trust formed by the Government of India for the construction of a Ram temple.[64][65]

The court referenced the 2003 report from the ASI, as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.[66][67] The Supreme Court, in its landmark judgement concluded that the underlying structure beneath the mosque was not an Islamic structure, and also concluded that no evidence was found that a non-Islamic structure was specifically demolished for the construction of the Babri Masjid.[67][68] Another salient aspect in the apex court's judgement is on the question on the claim of Hindus that disputed structure as the birthplace of Rama. The court observed that the Hindu claim is 'undisputed' and opined that there is clear evidence that Hindus believed that site to be Rama's birthplace.[69][70]

Terror attack
See also: 2005 Ram Mandir attack
On 5 July 2005, five Lashkar-e-Taiba's terrorists[71][72] attacked the makeshift Ram temple at the site of destroyed Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, India. All five were shot dead in the ensuing gunfight with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), while one civilian died in the grenade attack that the attackers launched in order to breach the cordoned wall. The CRPF suffered three casualties, two of whom were seriously injured with multiple gunshot wounds.

Trust formation and start of construction
The trust was eventually formed under the name of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra. On 5 February 2020, it was announced in the Parliament of India that the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi had accepted a plan to construct the temple. Two days later, on 7 February, 2.0 hectares (5 acres) of land was allocated for a new mosque to be built 22 km (14 mi) away from Ayodhya city in Dhannipur village.[64][65]

Architecture
See also: Hindu temple architecture
The original design for Ram Mandir was devised in 1988 by the Sompura family of Ahmedabad.[3] The Sompuras have contributed to the design of over 100 temples worldwide for at least 15 generations, including the Somnath temple.[73] The chief architect of the temple was Chandrakant Sompura, assisted by his two sons, Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, who are also architects.[74]

A new design, with some changes from the original, was prepared by the Sompuras in 2020,[74] per the Hindu texts, the Vastu shastra and the Shilpa shastras.[75] The temple will be 250 feet (76 m) wide, 380 feet (120 m) long and 161 feet (49 m) high.[76] Upon completion, the temple complex became the world's third largest Hindu temple.[74] It is designed in the Maru-Gurjara architecture of Nagara style, a type of Hindu temple architecture found primarily in northern India.[73] A model of the proposed temple was showcased during the Prayag Kumbh Mela in 2019.[77]

The temple's main structure has been built on a raised platform with three storeys. It has five mandapas in the middle of the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) and on the entrance passage. The Shri Ram Darbar, located on the first floor, comprises five halls – Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prarthana Mandap, and Kirtan Mandap. In Nagara style, the mandapas are decorated with shikharas.[78][79] Adorned with deity statues, the temple includes dedicated mandirs for Surya, Bhagwati, Ganesh, and Shiv at the corners. Annapurna and Hanuman temples are on the northern and southern arms. The foundation features a 14-metre (46 ft)-thick roller-compacted concrete layer resembling artificial rock, with a 21-foot (6.4 m) granite plinth for moisture protection, avoiding iron use. Accessibility is ensured with ramps, lifts, and facilities for the elderly and differently-abled. A pilgrims facility centre for 25,000 people offers medical and locker services. Environmental focus preserves 70% of the 70-acre (28 ha) area as green space, emphasising water conservation.[80][81][82]

The temple has a total of 366 columns. The columns have 16 idols each to include the incarnations of Shiva, the 10 Dashavataras, the Chausath Yoginis, and the 12 incarnations of the goddess Saraswati. The width of the stairs are 16 feet (4.9 m). Per scriptures dedicated to the design of temples dedicated to Vishnu, the sanctum sanctorum is octagonal in shape.[75] According to the temple committee, the site has a capability to handle 70,000 visitors.[83] Larsen & Toubro offered to oversee the design and construction of the temple free of cost, and became the contractor of the project.[84][85] The Central Building Research Institute, National Geophysical Research Institute and the Bombay, Guwahati and Madras IITs have assisted in areas such as soil testing, concrete supply and design.[86][87]

The construction work has been accomplished with 600,000 cubic feet (17,000 m3) of sandstone from Baansi in Rajasthan.[75] No iron and steel has been used in the construction of the temple, and the fusing of the stone blocks has required ten thousand copper plates.[88] In a culturally significant move, Thailand also symbolically contributed to the inauguration of the Ram Mandir, by sending soil to the Ram Janmabhoomi, building on their prior gesture of sending water from two rivers in Thailand to honour the temple.[89]

According to the temple trust, the final blueprint of Ram Mandir included temples dedicated to Surya, Ganesha, Shiva, Durga, Vishnu and Brahma in the temple grounds.[90]

Fundraising
The Ram Mandir was built with funds gained through international fundraising drives, involving nearly two million volunteers. Ramnath Kovind was the first to contribute, donating ₹500,000 on 14 January 2021, during his tenure as the president of India.[91][92] Over 127 million donations amounting to approximately ₹50 billion were received by the temple.[93][92][94][95] Some media outlets in India claimed that the construction of the Ram mandir was one of the world's biggest crowd funded projects.[96] Fundraising by the Mandir trust has ended on 27 February 2021.[97]

In 2015, the Hindu Mahasabha, among the leading organisation involved in the Ram Mandir issue, alleged the BJP-affiliate Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) of carrying out donation scam of over ₹1,400 crore (US$170 million) over the construction of the temple. The VHP denied this allegation.[24]

In 2019, the national spokesperson of the Nirmohi Akhara, Mahant Sitaram Das, accused the VHP of carrying out a ₹1,400 crore (US$170 million) scam over the temple.[23] Political leaders from opposition parties have also questioned the methods of fund collection.[98][99]

The public were warned of instances in which online scammers posed as fundraisers.[100]

Construction

The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust began the first phase of construction of the Ram Mandir in March 2020.[101][102] The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India caused a temporary suspension of the construction.[103][104] On 25 March 2020, Ram's idol was moved to a temporary location in the presence of the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath.[105] In preparation for the temple's construction, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) organised a 'Vijay Mahamantra Jaap Anushthan', in which individuals would gather at different places to chant the 'Vijay Mahamantra' – Shri Ram, Jai Ram, Jai Jai Ram, on 6 April 2020. This was said to ensure "victory over hurdles" in constructing the temple.[106]

It was officially announced by Champat Rai, the General Secretary of the Sri Ram Janmbhoomi Kshetra Trust, that 22 January 2024 would be the scheduled date for the installation of the Ram Lalla idol in the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum). On 25 October 2023, a formal invitation was extended to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the ceremony.[107]

In 2020, the national spokesperson of the Nirmohi Akhara, Mahant Sitaram Das, criticised the BJP's decision to have the temple foundation begun by Narendra Modi and said that the work of building the temple should be done only by the religious priests.[26] A number of Hindutva proponents, including online social media influencers, raised objections over the temple's construction with regards to its design and involvement of the Muslims, claiming that they found Islamic motifs in the Ram Mandir. Champat Rai, the general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust, responded to these concerns by saying that temple was being sculpted by experts, and there could be no question about their religion.[108][verification needed] The vice-president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Pandit Ashok Sharma, said that the BJP "got the entire thing politicised."[25]

A number of opposition parties, as well as BJP members themselves, have criticised the BJP for using the temple to for gain political mileage.[109] The President of the Congress, Mallikarjun Kharge, had questioned the authority of Home Minister Amit Shah, after he declared the opening date of the temple.[110] The BJP leader Subramanian Swamy questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's involvement in Ram Mandir's inauguration.[111] The Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has criticised the Indian media for diverting attention from critical governance issues by overly focusing on the temple.[112]

Bhumi Pujan ceremony

On the occasion of Bhumi Pujan, the Ram Lalla's dress was stitched by tailors Bhagwat Prasad and Shankar Lal, a fourth generation tailor to Rama's idol.[113]

The temple construction officially started again after a Bhumi-Pujan (transl. ground breaking ceremony) on 5 August 2020. The three-day long Vedic ritual was held ahead of the groundbreaking ceremony, which revolved around the installation of a 40 kg (88 pounds) silver brick as the foundation stone by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[3] On the day before on 4 August, the Ramarchan Puja (transl. Puja of Rama's feet) was performed, in order to ritually invite all the major deities into the temple.[114]

On the occasion of the Bhoomi Poojan, soil and holy water were collected from several religious places across India, such as the Triveni Sangam of the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati at Prayagraj, the head of the Kaveri River at Talakaveri in Karnataka, and the Kamakhya Temple in Assam.[115] Soil was also sent from various Hindu temples, gurudwaras and Jain temples across the nation, as well as from the four pilgrimage sites in Char Dham, to bless the temple.[116]

Before the ceremony, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought Hanuman's blessing by praying at the Hanuman Garhi Temple in Ayodhya.[117] The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, Chief of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Mohan Bhagwat, Chief of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and Chief of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, Nritya Gopal Das and Narendra Modi gave speeches.[117]

Some priests and religious leaders, such as Swaroopanand Saraswati, complained that 5 August was not a ritually auspicious date and that the ceremony did not follow proper ritual procedures. They also claimed that the function did not include a havan.[118] Writer and activist Arundhati Roy, a noted critic of PM Modi, pointed out that the chosen date marked one year since the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.[50] The Pakistan Foreign Office issued a statement criticising India for commencing for constructing a temple on the former site of the destroyed Babri Masjid.[119]

In 2017, the Hindu Mahasabha accused the BJP, Bajrang Dal and other Sangh Parivar organisations of hijacking the Ram Mandir despite having no involvement in its long battle.[120][25] In 2020, Pramod Joshi, the national spokesperson of the Hindu Mahasabha, said that the real credit of Ram Mandir belongs to Hindu Mahasabha, and that the Hindu Mahasabha should have performed the bhumi pujan, but instead had been kept away. He added that the committee for the temple was formed at the BJP's central office and the Hindu Mahasabha was sidelined.[121]

2021–present
The temple trust decided to launch a nationwide "mass contact and contribution campaign" aimed at reaching 55–600 million people.[87] Voluntary donations of ₹1 (1.2¢ US) and higher were accepted.[122] On 1 January 2021, former President Ram Nath Kovind made the first contribution towards the construction of the Ram Mandir by donating more than ₹5 lakh (US$5,900).[123] Several leaders and notable personalities across the nation followed this. By April 2021, around ₹5,000 crore (US$590 million) was collected from donations across India.[124][125] Nearly 150,000 VHP activists participated in collecting donations. The temple trust also received donations from the members of the Muslim and Christian communities.[126]


View of the Ram Mandir under construction in 2022
In August 2021, a viewing location was created for the public to observe the construction works in the temple site.[127] Following the groundbreaking ceremony, up to 40 feet (12 m) of debris were removed and the remaining earth compacted.[128] The foundation was made using roller-compacted concrete.[129] A total of 47–48 layers, with each layer 1-foot (0.30 m) high, were completed by mid-September 2021.[128][130] Due to electricity supply issues in Mirzapur, the cutting of the sandstone was slowed down.[90] In early 2022, a video was released by the temple trust, showing the planned construction of the temple in 3D along with other related information.[131][132][5]

In January 2023, two 60-million-year-old Shaligram rocks, 26 tonnes and 14 tonnes respectively, were sent from the Gandaki River in Nepal. These rocks were used to carve the idol of Ram Lalla in the sanctum sanctorum.[133] In August 2023, according to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, 70% of the groundwork was completed and 40% of the roof work was completed.[134] In December 2023, the entire base, along with the six smaller temples that surround the main temple, which consists of the sanctum sanctorum, were almost completed.[135] For its consecration, only the ground floor was opened.[136] The temple is expected to be completed by July 2025.[137]

Consecration

On 22 June 2023, Temple Construction Committee chairman Nripendra Misra announced that the ground floor of the three-story temple was complete and was expected to open for the devotees in January 2024.[138] The Ram Mandir Teerth Kshetra Trust announced that Hindu astrologers had selected 22 January 2024 as the auspicious date for the consecration ceremony.[139]

In preparation for the Prana Pratishtha (consecration) ceremony, the Government of Uttar Pradesh earmarked ₹100 crore (US$12 million) for 'Ramotsav', a series of religious events that spanned 826 local bodies across Uttar Pradesh along with the Ram Paduka Yatra, commencing in December 2023 and culminating in the grand celebrations from Makar Sankranti on 16 January 2024, and lasting until the inauguration of the Ram Mandir on 22 January. The yatra followed the Ram Van Gaman Path, retracing Rama's 14-year exile from Ayodhya.[140] The trust, the Government of Uttar Pradesh, and Ayodhya city administrators carried out extensive preparations to accommodate the influx of devotees and invited guests from all over the world.[141] Strict security measures were enacted in and around the temple premises.[142] The Government of Uttar Pradesh announced public holiday to mark the occasion. The Government of India and some state governments declared a half day holiday.[143]

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was invited to perform the Prana Pratishtha of the newly made idol in the sanctum sanctorum.[144] In preparation, he undertook an 11-day fast, consuming only coconut water and fruit and sleeping on the ground at night.[145] He performed the consecration ceremony on 22 January 2024 from 12:15 PM to 12:45PM IST.[146] Prime Minister Modi urged every Indian to light up diyas to mark the occasion and celebrate it like Diwali.[147]


Prime Minister Modi during Prana Pratishtha
The guests were addressed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat and Prime Minister Modi.[148][149] Modi also spoke of Rama as a symbol of righteousness and unity.[150]

While Yogi Adityanath's address was steeped in religious fervor, celebrating the Ram Mandir as a victory for faith and perseverance. He praised the devotion of millions who contributed to the temple's construction and acknowledged the divine blessings that guided the process.[151][152]

Mohan Bhagwat spoke of the Ram Mandir as a symbol of national pride, marking the revival of India's cultural heritage. He emphasised the importance of preserving ancient traditions and values in a rapidly modernising world.[153]

The guest list also included prominent industrialists, scientists, actors, army officers, spiritual leaders and Padma awardees.[154][155] The event was organised by Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra.[156]

None of the four Shankaracharyas of the four cardinal mathas, citing various reasons, took part in the ceremony.[157][158][159] Sringeri Sharada Peetham issued a denial that its head seer Bharathi Tirtha had expressed some displeasure and called the ceremony a "matter of joy" for all Hindu believers.[160] Tirtha blessed the event and sent an administrative officer, Gowrishankar as representative of the matha.[161] The head seer of Govardhan Math, Nischalananda Saraswati said that the ceremony deviated from established tradition.[162] The head seer of Jyotir Math, Swami Avimukteshwaranand has stated that the ceremony is against Hindu sastras as the temple is still under construction.[163][164] The head seer of the Dwarka Sharada Peetham, Swami Sadanand Saraswati welcomed the ceremony as a "long-awaited moment".[165] He said that none of the four Shankaracharyas were angry and that it was not appropriate for them to attend given, the massive crowd expected.[166]

Impact and associated activities

The temple construction has been accompanied by a $10 billion transformation plan for Ayodhya,[a] "encompassing a new airport, revamped railway station, and township development", fostering multiple hotel development projects and stimulating various economic activities.[169][170] As Hindu devotees all over the world throng to have a darśana (auspicious viewing) of this deity, the subsequent economic impact has been estimated to further enrich the state by the end of the year 2024 by four trillion Indian rupees (equivalent to 48 billion US dollars).[171]

Given its religious significance among Hindus, it is estimated that with 50 million annual visitors, Ayodhya's Ram temple is likely to become the most visited Hindu pilgrimage site in India.[172] After the opening of the Ram Temple to public on 23 January 2024, Ayodhya has welcomed 2.4 million visitors in just 12 days.[173] Based on the current visitor numbers, the Ayodhya's Ram temple is projected to become one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in the world, surpassing Mecca and the Vatican.[174] Given the temple rush by devotees from all parts of India, it was estimated that spiritual tourism at Ayodhya has potential to create thousands of jobs as more manpower is required to cater the needs of the Ram mandir visitors and also attract huge investments.[175][176]

On April 17, 2024, the first Ram Navami (Ram's birth) festival after the consecration of the Ram Temple was celebrated by thousands of devotees.[177] On this occasion, the Ram Temple witnessed a unique event at noon as the forehead of the Ram Lalla idol was anointed with a ray of sunlight, known as Sūrya Tilaka (transl. Sun tilak).[178] As the sun rays illuminated the forehead of the Lord Ram Lalla idol, scores of devotees celebrated the event.[177] The development of the Sūrya Tilaka mechanism involved collaboration between scientists from Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee, and the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIAP), Bangalore, who devised a sophisticated apparatus consisting of mirrors and lenses to direct a beam of light to the deity's forehead, marking a significant scientific feat.[178][177]

In popular culture

Slogans
Maṁdira vahīṁ banāēm̐gē (transl. The temple will be built exactly there) is an expression in Hindi, and has become one of the most popular slogans concerning the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and the Ram Mandir. It has been used as early as 1985–86, was popularised in the 1990s, and has several variations.[182][183]

It has been a symbol of hope and it has become a part of festivities, and has also become a part of stand-up comedy, jokes and memes.[184][185] In 2019, the slogan was used in the Parliament of India,[184] and it has also been used by media houses.[186][187] The slogan has been used as a threat as well as a vow.[188]

There are variations of the slogan such as one used by Lal Krishna Advani: "Saugaṁdha Rāma kī khātē haiṁ, hama maṁdira vahīṁ banāēm̐gē" (transl. We take a vow of Rama that we will build the temple exactly there).[182] Other variations and adaptations include "Vahīṁ banēgā maṁdira" (transl. A temple will be built there),[186] "Jahām̐ Rāma kā janma huā thā, hama maṁdira vahīṁ banāēm̐gē" (transl. The temple will be built where Rama was born),[183] "Rāmā Lallā hama āēm̐gē, maṁdira vahīṁ banāēm̐gē" (transl. Ram Lalla, we will come, the temple will be built there, or Ram Lalla we will come to construct a Mandir exactly there)[183] and "Pahalē maṁdira, phira sarakāra" (transl. First the temple, then the government).[189]

Hanuman Garhi Temple is a Hindu temple of Hanuman in Uttar Pradesh, India. Located in Ayodhya, it is one of the most important temples in the city along with other temples such as Ram Mandir and Nageshwar Nath.[1] This shrine is under the charge of Bairagi Mahants of Ramanandi Sampradaya and Nirvani Akhara.

History
Hanuman Garhi temple is located near Ram Janmabhoomi. According to Legend, after defeating Ravana when Lord Rama and Mata Sita along with Lord Hanuman returned to Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, Lord Hanuman started living in a cave in Ayodhya to protect Ramkot. According to the Skanda Purana, King Vikramaditya built Hanuman Garhi along with 360 other temples. But Aurangzeb destroyed The Hanuman Garhi and built a Mosque. Later, The Bairag occupied the land by defeating Nawab Shujauddula the King of Awadh. They removed the Mosque and built a new temple for Lord Hanuman. Some Muslims thought that Hanuman Garhi was built on a mosque. Therefore they tried to break the temple many times but failed. In 1855, the Nawab of Awadh granted land revenue to build the temple.[2][3] Historian Sarvepalli Gopal has said that the 1855 dispute was not for the Ayodhya temple dispute but for the Hanuman Garhi temple.[2]

Architecture
Hanuman Garhi Temple is shaped like a four-sided fort with circular ramparts at each corner, housing shrines dedicated to the primary deity Hanuman. There are 76 stairs to reach the main temple, where the garbha griha, adorned with silver carvings, awaits. The central has three intricately designed doors leading to the inner chamber. Within, a 6-inch deity of Hanuman, depicted in his youthful (Bal) form, is positioned on the lap of his mother Anjani.[4] A silver tulsi garland, inscribed with the name of Rama is adorned by Hanuman. The verses of the Hanuman Chalisa are inscribed on the temple walls. The temple features a Victory Pillar, known as Vijay Stambh.
